***Can AI learn to obey physics?***
:::

I am an AI Research Scientist at the UK Atomic Energy Authority, where I lead a team developing actionable surrogate models for exascale simulations and data-driven models for plasma control and reactor design. Concurrently, I'm pursuing a PhD in Machine Learning under Dr. Marc Deisenroth at University College London.

As a visiting AI Researcher at the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory - STFC, I conduct foundational research on enhancing machine learning models' robustness and interpretability through physics-based approaches.


### Current Research: 

* Neural Operators
* Physics Informed Neural Networks
* Bayesian Optimisation
* Conformal Prediction

**Building [simvue.io](https://simvue.io)** : AI-driven, open-source simulation management and tracking dashboard for streamlining engineering workflows. Developed with public funding from the UK Government. Currently in private $\beta$.
