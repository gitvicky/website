***Can AI learn to obey physics?***
::: -->

I am a senior research scientist at the [UK Atomic Energy Authority](https://ccfe.ukaea.uk/) (UKAEA), where I lead a team developing "actionable" surrogate models for exascale simulations and data-driven models for the Fusion industry. My research focusses on enhancing machine learning models' performance, robustness and interpretability through physics-based approaches. 

I am also a visiting researcher with the [SciML group at STFC's Rutherford Appleton Laboratory](https://www.scd.stfc.ac.uk/Pages/Scientific-Machine-Learning.aspx). 

Concurrently, I'm pursuing a PhD in Machine Learning under [Marc Deisenroth](https://www.deisenroth.cc/) in the [Sustainability and Machine Learning Group](https://www.sml-group.cc/) at [University College London](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/ai-centre/).

<!-- Current Hot Take: "The world would be so much better if we could just invert these matrices."  -->

### Current Research: 

* Physics-Informed Machine Learning
* Continuous Dynamics Modelling
* Uncertainty Quantification
* Design of Experiments

**Building [simvue.io](https://simvue.io)** : AI-driven, open-source simulation management and tracking dashboard for streamlining engineering workflows. Developed with public funding from the UK Government. Currently in private $\beta$.
