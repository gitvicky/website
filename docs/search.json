    "text": "Can AI learn to obey physics?\n\nI am a Research Scientist at the UK Atomic Energy Authority, where I lead a team developing “actionable” surrogate models for exascale simulations and data-driven models for the Fusion industry. My research focusses on enhancing machine learning models’ performance, robustness and interpretability through physics-based approaches.\nI am also a visiting researcher at STFC’s Rutherford Appleton Laboratory.\nConcurrently, I’m pursuing a PhD in Machine Learning under Dr. Marc Deisenroth at University College London.\n\nCurrent Research:\n\nPhysics-Informed Machine Learning\nContinuous Dynamics Modelling\nUncertainty Quantification\nDesign of Experiments\n\nBuilding simvue.io : AI-driven, open-source simulation management and tracking dashboard for streamlining engineering workflows. Developed with public funding from the UK Government. Currently in private \\(\\beta\\).\n\n“If there is a God, it must be a differential equation” - Bertrand Russell"
