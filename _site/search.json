    "text": "Can AI learn to obey physics?\n\nI am an AI Research Scientist at the UK Atomic Energy Authority, where I lead a team developing actionable surrogate models for exascale simulations and data-driven models for plasma control and reactor design. Concurrently, I’m pursuing a PhD in Machine Learning under Dr. Marc Deisenroth at University College London.\nAs a visiting AI Researcher at the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory - STFC, I conduct foundational research on enhancing machine learning models’ robustness and interpretability through physics-based approaches.\n\nCurrent Research:\n\nNeural Operators\nPhysics Informed Neural Networks\nBayesian Optimisation\nConformal Prediction\n\nBuilding simvue.io : AI-driven, open-source simulation management and tracking dashboard for streamlining engineering workflows. Developed with public funding from the UK Government. Currently in private \\(\\beta\\).\n\n“If there is a God, it must be a differential equation” - Bertrand Russell"

    "text": "I’m an environmental technologist, working at the US Geological Survey on improving how we deliver water data to the public. In prior roles, I split my time between predictive modeling (to monitor forest carbon sequestration across New York State, track the development of early-successional forests, and more) and visualization (including using game engines as a GIS and making it easier to make reproducible VR environments for research). By training I’m either an ecologist (specializing in landscape and translational ecology) or environmental scientist; professionally, I’ve worked as a data analyst, software engineer, and chicken farmer.\nOn this site I keep a list of my publications, presentations, and my CV, as well as a technical blog."
