***Can AI serve as a Universal Physics Engine ?***
:::

***


Need to a background on the different kind of approaches being taken:

1. Surrogate Models of all kinds. 
2. Foundation Models for Physics 
3. Generative Enginering - PhysicsX, Zoo.dev and the varioud likes of those. 
4. Math proofing approaches 
5. Text-Code is all you need with the right software - Bring in the Karpathy tweet.
